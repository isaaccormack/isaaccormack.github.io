## Atomic Habits Takeaways

- It's easier to avoid temptation than resist it
  - Self-control is only a short-term strategy, better to remove yourself from the environment (physically, visually, etc.)
- Start small
  - Overcoming the friction of starting the activity is the hardest part
    - Tell yourself you'll try the activity for only 2 minutes - this will be enough to get you in the flow
